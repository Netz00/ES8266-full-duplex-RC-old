# ESP8266-remote-control
Real ESP12e, ESP8266 remote control! I used RC car just as an example, it could be and an aircraft or robotic arm with this control system. There are many projects on this subject but I haven't found anyone who used this solution. I used UDP(2nd most famous protocol after TCP) to control RC car and achieved great speed and accuracy. Lot of other projects use TCP, and web browser, which is great if you need to turn on the lamp, but if you need dynamicaly control with great accuracy it's not. So my controler uses esp8266 built in PWM which acquired me range from 0 to 1023 by default. In other word I got from 0 to 1024 for turning right, and same for left, forward and back. If you use step motors you could use more of that range. The controler is simple android apk where you enther IP and port, IP could be your local, it's to possible to start access point and connect esp to smartphone and use it without router, or connect to router and forward port on router and achieve "unlimited" range. I agree that code can be optimised and even work faster, but I hadn't got any need for more speed.
